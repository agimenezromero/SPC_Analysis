# ChainAnalysis
Graphical interface in PyQt5 for the analysis of chain formation.

# Overview
The aim of this program is to simplify and automate the analysis of chain formation of superparamagnetic colloids under magnetic fields. With this graphical interface the analysis of different kinds of aggregation, including chain formation among others, can be done simply and easily, so anyone with basic or even null programming notions will be able to use all the software features. Although the software use is quite intuitive, a documentation has been written to assure its properly use, so we strongly recommend having a look on it, specially to understand the use of the "lateral_chains_finder" function.
